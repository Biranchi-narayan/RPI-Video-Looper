# Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is needed to access to the Raspberry from the instance in Amazon Web Services or from another system hosting the Web Page.

Here you will find a basic configuration in a Vodafone Router. In nearly every Router the configuration will be the same.

## Configuration 

First you need to access to your Router. Usually with the IP 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

In some Routers you won't need to save a special IP to the Raspberry but in others like some 
TP-LINK models a Reservation will be needed.

Now go to Port Forwarding settings in your Router. It may be like this:

Here we will configure a name for this rule, the system that will be forwarded, the public port and the local port
